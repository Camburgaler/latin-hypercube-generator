    "description": "An excerpt from the [Wikipedia article on latin hypercube sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling#cite_note-C3M-1): \"Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a statistical method for generating a near-random sample of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. The sampling method is often used to construct computer experiments or for Monte Carlo integration.\" This project was written during a summer internship that I did for TechSource, Inc., an LANL-adjacent company in Los Alamos, New Mexico. I needed to better understand Monte Carlo integration, and this helped to facilitate that. Since then, I have updated the project to be more accessible and easier to use. The demo allows you to select the configurations for running producing LHC samples, visualizes the results, and allows you to download the CSV output."
